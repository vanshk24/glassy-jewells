# Component Library

- Use the existing component library (`/app/components/ui/`) as building blocks for UI components.
- You may create new components in `/app/components/` folder
- Favor reusing components over copy-pasting code snippets
- Use Radix-UI components where appropriate for accessibility and functionality.

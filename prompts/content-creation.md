- When creating different site sections, create routes for them in the \`app/routes\` directory.
- Change \`app/routes.ts\` AFTER all other changes.
- Use kebab-case for file and folder names.
- Google Fonts are specified in the \`links\` export in \`app/root.tsx\`. Avoid using \`@import\` in CSS files to import new ones.
